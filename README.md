# zalgo codec

A crate for converting an ASCII text string or file to a single unicode character. Can also do the same to python code while still letting the code run as before.

This crate is a port of the python code by [Scott Conner](https://github.com/DaCoolOne/DumbIdeas/tree/main/reddit_ph_compressor) to Rust. All credit goes to him.
