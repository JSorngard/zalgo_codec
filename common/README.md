# zalgo-codec-common

A crate for converting an ASCII text string or file to a single unicode character. Can also do the same to python code while still letting the code run as before by wrapping it in a decoder.
This crate provides the non-macro functionality of the crate [`zalgo-codec`](https://docs.rs/zalgo-codec/latest/zalgo_codec/).
